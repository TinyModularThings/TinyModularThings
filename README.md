The TinyModularThings Minecraft Mod

The TinyModularThings mod is a mod that is based on other mods.
The simplest explanation is that this is a library that will work alone if decided.

The TinyModularThings mod is not only a mod, however it is a mod that can be used as a modpack itself. (I know, it sounds weird.)
It contains these mods, which are taken over / rebuilt / selfcreated / rewitten.

1: SpmodAPI: It's my mod. I have rewrittern it at this stage. You can say that this is a funny mod where there will also be some useful stuff included. It also contains plants, building blocks, and some funny stuff like drugs or AnimalFarts.
2: TinyModularThing: I have also created this mod by myself. This mod is a technical mod. It adds some utility blocks/items/features to the game. This mod is made for people that know what they want. The features are really obvious. The blocks do exactly what they say.
3: JBucketFiller: This mod is not said inside but it is inside. This mod only adds 3 Blocks. How they work is pretty obvious. Here is the original thread link: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1277676
4: Compact Windmills: This mod was taken over my me. I just grabbed me the source and have rewritten it. Aroma1997 said he will no longer support this mod, because he is in the IC2 dev team. Which is a two sided sword in my opinion. He is a guy with good ideas however he does not have a good imagination for mods, however a good one for IC2. But he made some mistakes in his code which can be bad if you use it. 
I hope they fix it. I took the mod over because I could not run it anymore on my server, because it used up all of my ram over time which was not funny at all. (Note: He did the same mistakes in IC2, I do not know if they still exist within the mod) The thread link to the original mod: http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1287828

Now to the mods which I plan to take over or bring back to live.

1: BC&IC2CrossoverMod. 
2: RocketScience.
3: LaserMod (If I can.)
4: Bacon Mod (Maybe I am not sure yet.)
5: PowerCraft (That will sadly not happen because I am not good enough to code what they did. This mod is extremly powerful, but also extremely dead. If there is someone who can bring it back to life like it was before without the the bugs of the 1.4.7 version, I will try to help as much as I can.)
6: I do not know any more, if I find more then I will try to take them over.

Core Coders: Speiger.
Texturer:

Redled72: An awesome guy who made really cool stuff in Minecraft. Sadly he stoped playing Minecraft. He made me awesome textures and he was also one of the creators of the TinyChest mod, which we boeh designed together. Thank you for teaching me your knowledge Redled72, without you I would have so much knowledge about coding.

Alex: Alex is a really good texturer. He helped me out with textures, some ideas, and sometimes some code if he really wanted something to be in the mod. Thank you for helping. 

Where my ideas come from:

Most ideas are still from brainstorming with Redled72. (99%)
Some ideas are from myself.(0,5%)
Some are from other People suggesting.(0,5%)
