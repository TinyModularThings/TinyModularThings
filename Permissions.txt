You are allowed to use these sources to make it better and/or cleaner, or help yourself overcome a coding problem (with limitations).
If you copy any code from me, you have to give credit towards me.
You are not allowed to use the textures for your mods. These textures are ONLY for Speiger's mods. Or request permissions from Redled72 on Youtube.
You are not allowed to make your own versions of TinyModularThings or SpmodAPI.
Modpacks have to request before they add the Mod.
Every help is allowed and requested because 1 person allone can not do this! (Me, Speiger)

Every other option what is not clear defined have to be asked before.

You can find me here on GitHub, Youtube, and my page, Speiger.jimdo.com to request permissions or something.
